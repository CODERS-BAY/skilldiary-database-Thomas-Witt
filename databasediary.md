Today i was only able to start my first database-day at 13:00, because i had to go to a doctor in Freistadt before. 

In the afternoon i started (and finished) the "CodersBay-ERM". We were also instructed to make the "School-ERM" and the "Library-ERM". And what we can't finish today will be homework until next wednesday. I didn't have enough time to even start one of the two, so they will both be my homework. Fortunatly for me, I already made both back in Jannuary. I do plan on remaking them both because it will be good practise, but hey. It is good to have a backup plan. And lets be honest, do you really think Stefan would notice if i would hand in my previous work? Well lets see... 

Today I (re)learned, that you write entities with a capital first letter. Also that not only entities but also relationships can have atributes. And if you want to make a list as an atrubute, you instead make a new entity with the name of the list and where you wanted to put the list as an entitiy you write "(name of the list).id" instead.
